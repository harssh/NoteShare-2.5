NoteShare is a platform for both students and professors in a class to interact on. 
It will allow students to collaboratively compile group "notesheets" and give special
privileges to the most active contributors. We hope that NoteShare will streamline group
studying, as well as provide an open line of communication between all students and their
professors.
